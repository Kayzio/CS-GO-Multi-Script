**STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS** <-- I will let you know :)

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Multi Script
=============================================================

Purpose
-------------------------------------------------------------
This is not to be used in game (maybe deathmatch only ^^), but
rather is meant to have some with the features that Java provides.
I included all source so that you can see what I used. This is a great
project to learn about global event listener, JRobot, JavaFX, etc...

Most of the people said this just makes it harder to play the game, so
it's not fantastic. The only thing I would say is worth getting banned over
is the "camping" trigger bot and the crosshair overlay. The other features
don't really provide an unfair advantage in my opinion.

Either way, enjoy :)

Features
-------------------------------------------------------------
I'm too lazy right now, remind me to do this later :P
